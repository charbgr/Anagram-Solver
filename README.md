This GitHub repository hosts the code for the Android app [Anagram Solver](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bmpak.anagramsolver).

Description
-----------
Find any anagram for any given word INSTANTLY!

A word or phrase formed by reordering the letters of another word or phrase, such as garden to danger..
One word anagrams (where a single word is anagrammed into another single word) are sometimes referred to by wordplay specialists as transpositions. For example, "listen" is a transposition of "silent". 

You can type a regular or a scrambled word & see all the possible combinations.
Come up with a word and let the app find all the possible anagrams.
Browsing through random anagrams is a fun option!
You can also use the app as a spelling dictionary.

Languages:
* English
